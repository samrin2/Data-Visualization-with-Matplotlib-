# Data Visualization with Matplotlib

This project involves using the Matplotlib library to visualize household data. It includes the creation of a bar chart and a line chart from a Pandas DataFrame. The charts are customized with labels, titles, and legends.

## Visualizations

1. **Bar Chart**: Displays the total number of households per year.
2. **Line Chart**: Shows the average income and expenditure per year.

## Files

- `householdtask3.csv`: The dataset used for visualization.
- `total_households_per_year.png`: Bar chart showing total households per year.
- `income_expenditure_per_year.png`: Line chart showing average income and expenditure per year.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed (`pandas`, `matplotlib`).
2. Run the provided code to generate the visualizations.

This project was completed as part of an internship at Main Flow Service and Technology.
